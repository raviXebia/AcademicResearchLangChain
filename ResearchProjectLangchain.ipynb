            "The rise of autonomous AI agents creates fundamental challenges concerning their identity, accountability, and ethical alignment as they operate independently across digital ecosystems. To address these issues, the research introduces the **LOKA Protocol (Layered Orchestration for Knowledgeful Agents)**.\n",
            "\n",
            "LOKA is a novel, unified, systems-level architecture designed to build ethically governed, interoperable AI agent ecosystems. It proposes three core components:\n",
            "1.  **Universal Agent Identity Layer (UAIL):** For decentralized, verifiable agent identity.\n",
            "2.  **Intent-centric communication protocols:** For semantic coordination among diverse agents.\n",
            "3.  **Decentralized Ethical Consensus Protocol (DECP):** To enable agents to make context-aware decisions grounded in shared ethical baselines.\n",
            "\n",
            "Anchored in standards like Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs), LOKA aims to embed identity, trust, and ethics directly into the protocol layer, offering a scalable and future-resilient blueprint for responsible, transparent, and autonomous multi-agent AI governance.\n",
